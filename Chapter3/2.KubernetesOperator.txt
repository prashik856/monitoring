What is a Kubernetes Operator?
Operators are Kubernetes-specific applications (pods) that configure, manage and optimize
 other Kubernetes deployments automatically. 
They are implemented as a custom controller.

A Kubernetes Operator might be able to:

Install and provide sane initial configuration and sizing for your deployment, according to the specs of your Kubernetes cluster.
Perform live reloading of deployments and pods to accommodate for any user-requested parameter modification (hot config reloading).
Automatically scale up or down according to performance metrics.
Perform backups, integrity checks or any other maintenance task.

Basically, anything that can be expressed as code by a human admin can be automated inside a Kubernetes Operator.

Kubernetes Operators make extensive use of Custom Resource Definitions (or CRDs) 
to create context-specific entities and objects that will be accessed like any other Kubernetes API resource. 
For example, in the next sections, you will be able to interact with a ‘Prometheus’ Kubernetes API 
object which defines the initial configuration and scale of a Prometheus server deployment. 
Operators read, write and update CRDs to persist service configuration inside the cluster.
