PROMETHEUS OPERATOR - COMPONENTS ARCHITECTURE DESIGN

You can see that this diagram is similar to the one in part 2, 
where we were installing Prometheus components manually. 
There are, however, two important differences:

1. Different Prometheus deployments will monitor different resources:
    - One group of Prometheus servers (1 to N, depending on your scale) is going to monitor the Kubernetes internal component and state.
    - Another group of Prometheus server is going to monitor any other app deployed in your cluster.
2. Instead of directly creating Deployments and Services, we are going to use the CRDs to feed 
  the Operator with metrics sources. In the example above we have one Grafana service with two data sources,
   but we will show how to rearrange the component diagram in a declarative way thanks to the Prometheus Operator.
