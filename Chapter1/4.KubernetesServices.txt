8. How to monitor Kubernetes services with Prometheus exporters
Monitoring apps using Prometheus exporters

When the application do not expose Prometheus metrics out of the box.
In this case, we need to bundle a Prometheus exporter, an additional process that is able to 
retrieve the state/logs/other metrics formats of the main service and expose this information as Prometheus metrics.
In other words, Prometheus adapter.

E.g. Redis server and Prometheus sidecar container:
'''
# Clone the repo if you don't have it already
git clone git@github.com:mateobur/prometheus-monitoring-guide.git
kubectl create -f prometheus-monitoring-guide/redis_prometheus_exporter.yaml
'''

Now, we have deployed redis, inside which 2 containers are running. 
'''
kubectl get pod redis-546f6c4c9c-lmf6z
NAME                     READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
redis-546f6c4c9c-lmf6z   2/2       Running   0          2m
'''

Now, to scrape these metrics, we need to update the Prometheus configuration and reload.
'''
  - job_name: 'redis'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['redis:9121']
'''

This is what we do to obtain redis service metrics in prometheus format.
